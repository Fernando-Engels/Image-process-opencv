Some examples of problems given in the subject "algortihms and programming 2" in UJM, where Opencv is used in C++.

Exercises 3: Histograms
Open an RGB image and compute for each channels the corresponding 1D histogram.
Draw these 3 histograms in the original image with a transparency effect and display it.

Exercises 4: Class design
Design and implement a class which will allow you to display a frame (at a time t) from a video file and
2 other images:
1. One with 3x3 images draw on it, corresponding to the following gray images: the R channel
gray image (from RGB), B (from RGB), G (from RGB), H (from HSV), S (from HSV), V (from HSV),L* (from L*a*b*), a* (from L*a*b*) and b* (from L*a*b*). Each of these gray images at 1/3
resolution of the original image.
2. One with 3x3 histograms draw on it, corresponding to the following gray images: the R channel
gray image (from RGB), B (from RGB), G (from RGB), H (from HSV), S (from HSV), V (from HSV),
L* (from L*a*b*), a* (from L*a*b*) and b* (from L*a*b*).
